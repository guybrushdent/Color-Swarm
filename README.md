# Color-Swarm
A collection of ready-to-use Roccat Swarm profiles (only Vulcan Pro atm)
I just tested these on Windows, since I can't get Swarm to work in linux (use "eruption-gui" there)

Since there is no collection of things like these anywhere, I decided to make my own.

The profiles are color only atm.
I'm planning to add colored profiles with macros for some games.


->The 10 Finger-Profile is for learming to type fast with all fingers.
  Place your index finger of the left hand on "F" (or whereever this nub is for your layout(middle letter row, fourth from left))
  place the right index finger on "J" (same line, you get the point)
  and just use the different colored areas for the according fingers - good luck ;)

->Flags are just simple country flags

->gradient - just colors fading over your keyboard

->Games are empty atm - will add highlight colored profiles for games I like - feel free to add yours


Feel free to add your own key bindings and macros.



ROCCAT Swarm is a software made by the Roccat brand which belongs to Turtle Beach - I have no intensions of going against their copyrights - this is just a collection of profiles I created in the software and share with the community - I don't make any profits from this.
